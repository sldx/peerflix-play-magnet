peerflix-play-magnet
====================

Automator/applescript to automatically start downloading movies from magnet links.

It requires Peerflix. 


USE:
Copy magnet link to clipboard. Run script. It will start downloading the magnet link and open a finder window with the file's location. From there, the file can be played with the desired player. 


IMPREVEMENTS:
- I can't seem to find how to get from peerflix the torrent's "name" so I can play the file automatically. Help would be appreciated. 

- The path where the torrents are downloaded is currently hardcoded. If somebody has a better approach, please feel free to fork or send me a message with your idea.
